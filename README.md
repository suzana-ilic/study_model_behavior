# AI Model Behavior: Reading List & Study Group

Study Groups will be announced here: 
- Luma 🔗 https://luma.com/MLT-AI
- Substack 🔗 https://mltaicommunities.substack.com/

**AI Model Behavior Study Group** (Series)

Join us for a deep dive into how AI systems learn to behave, what guides their decisions, and how we can make them more aligned with human values. Each session, we'll spend 45 minutes reading a foundational paper or document on AI model behavior, safety, and alignment, followed by 30 minutes of discussion to extract key insights and debate implications.

Whether you're an AI researcher, developer, policy maker, or simply curious about how AI "thinks," this study group offers a structured way to understand the principles, methods, and critiques shaping the future of AI behavior. We'll cover everything from industry specifications to cutting-edge research on interpretability and safety.

**Format:** Pre-reading + 30 min focused study group reading + 30 min group discussion  
**Series:** Ongoing monthly sessions  
**Audience:** All levels welcome - from curious beginners to experienced practitioners
